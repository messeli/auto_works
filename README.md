#| EXTREME COMMENTING LEGEND - self explained: 
#| 00  "# "        - a commented out line, either as a depot or as an option of code
#| 01  "#| "       - comment for the following lines
#| 02  "#|"        - comment at the end of a line
#| 03  "#|:"       - the above line/calculation is explained 
#| 04  "#| :"      - indentation of ":" suggests dt this is the explanation of "#| " (see 01 above)
#| 05  "#|::"      - explanation of an explanation of sort "#|:"; extend this w/ the idea in 04.
#| 06  "#|Nt:"     - a note not strictly related to the immediate preciding line, cld b deductions
#| 07  "#|XXX"     - a block of code starts here 
#| 08  "#|X_YYY"   - a block of code under the block "XXX"
#| 09  "#|XY_ZZZ"  - a block of code under the block "X_YYY", d reference to d X block cn be omitd
#| 10  "#|XXX END" - a block of code ends here
#| 11  "#|..."     - continued line from either "#|:" or "#|::" or "#|XXX" or "#|Nt:" or "#|..." 
#| 12  "#| ..."    - continued line to the 1 above (also see 04 above for another case)
