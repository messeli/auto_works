The "weird" fold contins are the "outliers" in the fold continuations with lower epsH (eg 0.010 11 12 15 20) and lower zeta(1e-5 here only). 

The narrative is as follows:

These fold contins are sampled at epsH = 0.1 
Then the sample is continued in Omeg to get a whole solFam. 

It turns out that the whole solFam is now UNSTABLE. 
But the stability was as expected before the fold continuaiton (ie the regular epsH=0.1 with zeta=1e-5 Omeg solFam is stable above the LP and unstable below the LP.)

THE HYPOTHESIS is that the orbits can have different direction ?? in the whole-unstable cases...

So the TASK now is to get an orbit from the weird-foldContin one, and another orbit from the regular one at the same epsH=1e-1 and zeta=1e-5 values, and plot them in time lets say in MATLAB with pause(10 ms).


The orbits to see their orientation are
	orbit_from_weird_foldContin_sample_at_epsH1e-1_zeta1e-5_Omeg5
	orbit_from_weird_foldContin_sample_at_epsH1e-1_zeta1e-5_Omeg5_UZ2
	orbit_from_regular_sample_at_epsH1e-1_zeta1e-5_Omeg5
	orbit_from_regular_sample_at_epsH1e-1_zeta1e-5_Omeg5_UZ2

See the label 2-4 's of the 
	b.DL_cubic_zeta1e-5_epsH1e-1_weirdFold_Omeg 
	b.DL_cubic_zeta1e-5_epsH1e-1_Omeg branches
Indeed the weird (all unstable) one has its labels with a "5" like "5x". See the screenShots in

Label 3 of the weird one is of "55" (R1) type which is a 1:1 Resonance solution according to Table 4.6 of doc Auto (codim 2 table). See the data from the b.xxx in the screenShot

BACK TO THE HYPOTHESIS ABOVE: The fact is seen with the Libre office plots: the directions are the same.


[
As a side note, when continuing in Omeg from the weird fold contins, it does not start from a fold!??
So this is not a continuation of a fold at all!??
Regardless, the above hypothesis is what to answer first!
