The file ZilliCubic11_sideStudy2.auto has become too long. 

So I generated the sideStudy4 folder for : 

1 - the fold continuation in zeta and epsH (epsH and Omeg is done in the application) of d fold wtr Omeg. 
2 - one param periodic continuation in "Omeg from dat >> zeta >> epsH >> Omeg"
3 - See the parts 0-5/4 in IPS2_DL.auto for ultimate details.
